# ASCII Mirror

## Description

A real-time ASCII mirror that transforms your webcam feed into vintage digital art. Because sometimes staring at your pixelated face rendered in ASCII characters is exactly what you need to procrastinate intelligently.

## What it does

- Converts your webcam stream to ASCII art in real-time
- Offers multiple character sets <i>(from minimal to complex)</i>
- Provides different color modes <i>(Matrix green, blueprint...)</i>
- Allows density and contrast adjustment <i>(Warning: increasing density may slow down your browser)</i>
- Features pause/resume and fullscreen capabilities

## What it doesn't do

This isn't a cybersecurity tool for once. It won't hack the Pentagon, crack passwords, exploit CVEs or anything like that. It will, however, keep you entertained when you're supposed to be doing something productive.

## Installation

1. Download the HTML file
2. Open it in your browser
3. Allow camera access when prompted
4. Watch yourself become digital art  
  
But come on, I shouldn't need to explain how to open an HTML file, right?

## Browser Requirements

Any modern browser with webcam support. Works best in Chrome or Firefox. Your browser will ask for camera permission - this is normal and required for the magic to happen.

## Technical Notes

Built with pure JavaScript and browser APIs (Canvas, WebRTC). No external libraries, no frameworks, no tracking, no data collection. Just you, your camera, and some good old-fashioned DOM manipulation.
